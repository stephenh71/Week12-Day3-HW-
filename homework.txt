Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

Polymorphism
What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.


What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways. For example, lets say we have a class Animal that has a method sound().  Now lets say we two subclasses of Animal class: Horse and Cat that extends that Animal class. The sound method could return "Meow"for the Cat and "Neigh" for the Horse.  So the method would be polymorphic with a different outcome depending on which object it is called on.  


What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
sub-typing, inheritance


How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
Many


Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
see above


Composition
What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
When we pass a class into another class.  "Has a" relationship.

When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
Composition in java is achieved by using instance variables of other objects. For example, Person has-a Job relationship

What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?
code re-use, flexibility in invoking methods with multiple sub-classes.  Easy to modify.
